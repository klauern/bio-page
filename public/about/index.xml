      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a software developer and general Administrator of the Oracle Fusion Middleware
product suite.  Having a background in Software Engineering from the University
of Wisconsin &amp;ndash; Platteville, I have always had a keen eye on performance,
brevity, and simplicity in design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second, more modest career is in being an active member of the United States
Army - Reserve component, where I drill regularly.  I don&amp;rsquo;t do it for technical
skills, money, or prestige.  It provides me an immense set of intangibles in
terms of comraderie, teamwork, and the general feeling you get doing something
for a cause greater than your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home, I am a father and husband, raising four young boys in between all of
my committments above.  My wife, Katrina is incredibly supportive and talented
in her own right.  I can&amp;rsquo;t claim any of my achievements without recognizing the
incredible effort and support that she has provided me.&lt;/p&gt;
