Cloud-based infrastructures are extremely powerful and flexible, but it's no surprise that
vendors choose to make things easy to demo by choosing to omit some security practices that
would either be impractical or obscure the value that the products they're showing offer.

Much of my work these days has been around compliance efforts and developing solutions that make
securing infrastructures and workloads in the cloud "secure by default" and a simple choice to make
within our company.  To that end, our team's worked on and I've contributed to a number of interesting
projects that help pave the way for "secure by default" workloads:

* [ScoutSuite](https://github.com/nccGroup/ScoutSuite)
* [Cloud Custodian](https://cloudcustodian.io)
* [`danmx/sigil`](https://github.com/danmx/sigil)
