I am a very big fan of DevOps **as a cultural shift**, and I've recently
discovered that my own skillset is a great fit for Ops+Software Development than
simply making new apps.  With that, these are some of the following trends and
practices that I promote:

1. Release Pipelines
2. Infrastructure as Code
3. Version control of assets
4. Promoting "[The Three Ways](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/blogs-three-ways-devops)" of DevOps practices
5. Containerization of everything (Docker, Kubernetes)

...amongst other interests.  I'm a big proponent of applying software
craftsmanship towards infrastructure.  With the increased flexibility of
cloud-based architectures, this isn't even an option anymore, so the further you
can take this "Infrastructure as Code" aspect forward, the more likely you'll be
able to keep pace with your competitors.
