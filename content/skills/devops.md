I am a very big fan of DevOps as a cultural shift, and I've recently discovered my own skills work better with Ops+Software Development than simply making new apps.  In my opinion, Ops groups don't have enough of a background in applying some aspects of the Developer side:

1. Release Pipelines
2. Infrastrcutreu as Code
3. Version Control of assets

...among other aspects.  I'm a big proponent of applying software craftsmanship towards infrastructure.  With the increased flexibility of cloud-based architectures, this isn't even an option anymore, so the further you can take this "Infrastructure as Code" aspect forward, the more likely you'll be able to keep pace with your competitors.
