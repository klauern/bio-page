Unfortunately, there's a lot of code I cannot share due to restrictions from
previous employers, but I do still code on the side any projects
that I find would probably be better served in the public space. If you look at
my current [Github Repo](https://github.com/klauern?tab=repositories), I have
a number of languages I've written code for. At this point, languages don't
really scare me off the way they used to (Thank goodness). I've written code in
at least the following languages:

- Python 3.x
- [Java](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=user%3Aklauern+language%3ARuby&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults)
- [Golang](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=user%3Aklauern+language%3AGo&type=Repositories&ref=advsearch&l=Go&l=)
- [Clojure](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=user%3Aklauern+language%3AClojure&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults)
- [Ruby](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=user%3Aklauern+language%3ARuby&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults)

Anyways, life is short, so this is merely what I have free time to contribute to
when I'm not otherwise occupied saving the world (Army), my family (4 kids between
8-14), or working.
