Amazon Web Services is obviously a giant ecosystem of many services, so I'm not going to claim expertise
with the entirety of it.  That said, most of my experience thus far is around [IAM][iam], [AWS Organizations][orgs],
[Config][config], and [Cloudformation][cfn].  Secondarily, the 'supporting cast' of tools includes:

* EC2
* CloudTrail
* CloudWatch


[iam]: 
[orgs]:
[config]:
[cfn]:
