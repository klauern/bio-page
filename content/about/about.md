Hello and welcome to my personal bragging page! To learn a little about me:

I currently work as a Lead Technical Analyst for [Oshkosh Corporation][1], working on their
Enterprise Middleware team.  This position has been pretty interesting, giving me a wealth
of interesting project work and challenging initiatives, such as:

* Docker
* Kubernetes
* Ansible

All while working remotely!

I studied Software Engineering from the University of Wisconsin --
Platteville, where we dove as deep as assembly and analog electronics
development all the way up to hand-written source code interpreters. I have
always had a huge interest in automating out everything with an eye towards
performance, code brevity, and simplicity in design.

A second, more modest career is in being an active, drilling member of the
United States Army -- Reserve. I "[drill][2]" there monthly, so while not
working on servers, DevOps, automation or tooling at work, I'm generally
helping other Soldiers get trained and maintain readiness to be deployed at a
moment's notice. I don't do this for technical skills, money, or prestige.
Rather, it provides me an innumerable set of intangible skills in terms of
comraderie, teamwork, and the general feeling you get doing something for a
cause greater than your own.

If that weren't enough, when not working (at home) I am a father and husband,
raising **four** young boys in between all of the above committments. My
wife, Katrina is an incredible force in her own right, by being supportive,
talented, and busy on her own. I can't claim any of my achievements without
recognizing the incredible effort and support that she has provided me.
