title: "About Me"

Hello and welcome to my personal bragging page! To learn a little about me:

I am a software developer and System Administrator of a suite of Oracle Fusion Middleware
products running at a regional utility company. My current workload consists of
patching, monitoring, auditing, and otherwise securing and deploying various bits
to our environments. I studied Software Engineering from the University of Wisconsin --
Platteville, where we dove as deep as aseembly and analog electronics development
all the way up to hand-written source code interpreters. I have always had a huge
interest in automating out everything with an eye towards performance, code brevity,
and simplicity in design.

A second, more modest career is in being an active, drilling member of the United States
Army - Reserve. I drill there monthly, so while not working on servers at work,
I'm generally helping other Soldiers get trained and maintain readiness to be deployed
at a moment's notice. I don't do this for technical skills, money, or prestige.
Rather, it provides me an innumerable set of intangible skills in terms of comraderie,
teamwork, and the general feeling you get doing something for a cause greater than your own.

If that weren't enough, at home I am a father and husband, raising **four** young boys
in between all of the above committments. My wife, Katrina is an incredible force in
her own right, by being supportive, talented, and busy on her own. I can't claim any of
my achievements without recognizing the incredible effort and support that she has provided me.
